## Title : Leverage Genai via Rest APIs & Apply DevOps Principles to Build and Deploy Empowered Apps

In this session, we will explore how to harness the capabilities of cutting-edge Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and D-ID Studio by seamlessly integrating them into applications via their REST APIs.

By leveraging these APIs, developers can unlock these advanced AI models without the need for deep expertise in machine learning. We will delve into practical examples showing how to integrate Generative AI into your applications and how to use DevOps principles to build, deploy, and maintain these AI-powered solutions. Starting with an overview of each system, we will discuss their unique capabilities and real-world use cases.

Each AI system will be showcased through live demos. We will share the source code for each demo, along with a GitHub template repository that can be easily adapted to integrate other AI systems via their REST APIs.

Key takeaways being

- Learn how to integrate Generative AI models into your applications using REST APIs.

- Discover how to use DevOps principles to automate the deployment and management of AI-powered applications, using GitHub Actions ensuring continuous delivery and integration.
